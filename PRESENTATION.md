## Problem

* VPNs are being used increasingly throughout the world and all of them are offering a monthly subscription model.



## Open Issues

* account identity is not 100% anonymous, a paying account can still be traced back to, using its id.
  * can be countered using alternative "incognito" accounts.
  * hashgraph is destined to provide encrypted apis in the future.
* bad-actor vpns might return empty or false responses
